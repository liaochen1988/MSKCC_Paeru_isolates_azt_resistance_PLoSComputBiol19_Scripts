The whole project has been published in PLoS Computational Biology (https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007562&rev=2). Our project aims to understand metabolic consequences of NalD mutation by building integrative metabolic models--using RNA-seq data to constrain genome-scale metabolic models.

Fig. 7 and 8 should be reproducible by running codes contained in this repository. Notably, you need to get the iJN1411 model for Pseudomonas putida to run the codes (put the model file under the directory input_data). Please contact the authors (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/139121v1) for the model.
